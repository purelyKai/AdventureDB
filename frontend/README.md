# Databases-Project Frontend

## Setup

To setup this project, you will need to create a `.env.local` file as per the `.env.local.example` file, which contains ports consistent with the backend.

## Running on the OSU ENGR Servers

Set up is a comprehensive commmand that is the only one you will need. It will install dependencies, build, then start or restart the server using the `forever` command.

```bash
npm run start:prod
```
