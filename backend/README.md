# Backend

## Setup

To setup this project, you will need to create a `.env` file as per the `.env.example` file, which contains the port consistent with the frontend and your database credentials.

## Running on the OSU ENGR Servers

Set up is a comprehensive commmand that is the only one you will need. It will install dependencies, build, then start or restart the server using the `forever` command.

```bash
npm run start:prod
```
